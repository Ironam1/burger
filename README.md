# burger

This application is my first full stack project. I have created a server, a database and a client side application to demostrate CRUD.

This application is hosted on Heroku and can be found here: https://fathomless-ridge-51887.herokuapp.com/

When the user opens the application, a list of all burgers in the database will be shown. If the burger is located on the left side of the page, a button to devour the burger will be shown next to the burger name. If the burger is located on the right side, a button to delete the burger will be displayed.

The user can create a burger by using the input form. After creation, the user can update, or "devour" the burger. After eating, the user can delete the burger from the database.
