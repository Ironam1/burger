# burger

This application is my first full stack project. I have created a server, a database and a client side application to demostrate CRUD.

The user has the ability to add a burger of their choice to a database. Once the burger is added, they have the option to "devour" or modify the properties of their burger.

After modifiying, the user can then delete their burger from the database.
